Advanced Rappelz Map Editor (By C1ph3r)

Uses:

Viewing/Editing Rappelz Map Files

General notes:

- 3D viewing was partially implemented but ultimately I removed it because it was rather broken and bogged the program down
- NFM has some issues with adding new props (I haven't looked into this, but likely will unless another contributor wants to)
- All other .NF* editing/viewing seems completely function (I code cleaned/optimized several of these classes)

Future plans:

- Completely redesign threading to use .NET 4.5.1+ TASK api
- Review all .NF* classes for code optimizations and redundancy removal
- Link to example setup for program use

iSmokeDrow note:

This source was given to me some time ago by C1ph3r before he quit, it was given around to some friends (with permission from C1ph3r). It is now being pushed to the public in the hope that work on it can be continued/completed. I have cleaned up several upon several .cs files in the project and I have added some drag functionality to the minimap.

If you are going to download the source please contact me via: tealskyproject@hotmail.com (skype) or via pm on EPVP (SilentWisdom) and I will make you a contributor that way this repo can be updated!
