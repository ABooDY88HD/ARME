Advanced Rappelz Map Editor (By C1ph3r)

Uses:

Viewing/Editing Rappelz Map Files

Foreword:

C1ph3r was a giant when it came to being a "dev" for the Rappelz P-Server Scene, his work deserves to live on through those who still want to carry the mantle of Rappelz!

General notes:

- 3D viewing was partially implemented but ultimately I removed it because it was rather broken and bogged the program down
- NFM has some issues with adding new props (I haven't looked into this, but likely will unless another contributor wants to)
- All other .NF* editing/viewing seems completely function (I code cleaned/optimized several of these classes)

Future plans:

- Completely redesign threading to use .NET 4.5.1+ TASK api
- Review all .NF* classes for code optimizations and redundancy removal
- Link to example setup for program use

Updates so far:

Ok, so I've had this source a long time and really haven't messed with it since I first had it. What I have done so far:

- Added proper zooming support (mouse wheel) on the main map
- Added proper drag support to the mini-map (click-hold and drag)
-- Corrected minimap target indicator (red-box) scaling as main-map is zoomed
- ALL .NF* classes have been cleaned and optimized 
- Dropped partial 3D Support (Contact me for a version with this still implemented! [WARNING! 3D version is missing all updates]

With C1ph3r gone I am hoping that he will understand the communities need for this program to be updated and finished!
