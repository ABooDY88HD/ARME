iSmokeDrow note:

This source was given to me some time ago by C1ph3r before he quit, it was given around to some friends (with permission from C1ph3r). It is now being pushed to the public in the hope that work on it can be continued/completed. I have cleaned up several upon several .cs files in the project and I have added some drag functionality to the minimap.

If you are going to download the source please contact me via: tealskyproject@hotmail.com (skype) or via pm on EPVP (SilentWisdom) and I will make you a contributor that way this repo can be updated!
